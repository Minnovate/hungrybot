## Installation

First you will want to have a Hubot set up, and Github has some great documentation on that [here](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/README.md)!

## Usage

### Starting an order

You can start an order like this

    foodbot start order

Which will initiate a group order, having the bot populate a list of restaurant suggestions.

If you want something more specific, like a restaurant name or cuisine type, you can give the bot a search query as well.

    footbot start order pizza
